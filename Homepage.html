	<p class="paragraph">I’m Cory. I have been writing and making videos about Vermont’s people and politics since 2014. I was born and raised in the Green Mountain State, and recently graduated from The University of Vermont with a degree in Political Science. I’m currently based in Washington, D.C., completing Georgetown University’s journalism master’s program.

	Before ducking off and traveling Europe and the US this summer, (check out my Instagram for more) I was a reporter writing about Burlington, Vt. and Chittenden County, Vt. for VTDigger.org.</p>
